# <Module 2 Challenge>

## Description

### Working With CSS Challenge: Portfolio

I created this project to hone my skills in developing websites that are responsive when viewed on smaller devices in addition to being fully functional.

This project primarily serves as an example of how effective the CSS grid system can be when used correctly.

I've gained a lot of knowledge about the grid system and how it influences the page's overall design.
